DYLAN:
All file path's are hardcoded, meaning that files won't be always added to the right directories and they need to be adjusted throughout the whole file.
Files are a mess, imports do not make sense since they import files with the wrong names, so they need to be adjusted accordingly
No comments through the files
Models and parameters get defined multiple times, old test files aren't deleted, causing a mess.
README incomplete, The CVAE usses different classes then the MNIST_CNN_train file, the CVAE file had to be adjusted accordingly
Image size has not been defined correctly
Old causaleffect.py used in CVAE.py, causing code not to run
Alpha not defined correctly
Objective has to be IND_UNCOND
imsave function from scipy is deprecated and needs to be replaced
tensors not properly detached from GPU in make_mnist_qual.py
Only the alpha plot is generated

What is this even?:
